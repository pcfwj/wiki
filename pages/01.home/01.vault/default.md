### Prerequisites

To perform the tasks described in this guide, you need to have a Vault environment. Refer to the [Getting Started](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/install) guide to install Vault. Make sure that your Vault server has been [initialized and unsealed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/deploy).

> unzip vault_1.2.1_linux_amd64.zip -d /usr/local/bin
> echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
> source  ~/.bashrc
> ```



### Test vault

```bash
echo '10.76.2.35 vault-st.pp.akscsz.cn' >> /etc/hosts
export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault-st.pp.akscsz.cn
export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY="true"
```

### create version 2 kv secret
```bash
$ vault secrets enable -path secret2/ -version 2 kv

$ vault kv put secret2/a/b/c hello=123
Key              Value

# Keys
---
a/

$ vault kv list secret2/a/b

# Keys
---
c

$ vault kv list secret2/a/b/c
No value found at secret2/metadata/a/b/c
```





### vault kv get command is used to Retrieves data from the KV store
```bash
$ vault kv get secret2/a/b/c

$ vault kv put secret1/a/b/c hello=123
Success! Data written to: secret1/a/b/c
```



### delete one path (if you want to delete path secret1/a, firstly you need delete path a/b/c and path a/b )
```bash
$ vault delete secret1/a/b/c
Success! Data deleted (if it existed) at: secret1/a/b/c
```



! Q: How do I save multiple values at once?

The two examples introduced in this guide only had a single key/value pair. You can pass multiple values in a single command.

```sh
$ vault kv put kv-v1/dev/config/mongodb url=foo.example.com:35533 db_name=users \
 username=admin password=passw0rd
```

!! Or, read several secrets from a file:

```sh
$ tee mongodb.json <<EOF
{
    "url": "foo.example.com:35533",
    "db_name": "users",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "pa$$w0rd"
}
EOF

$ vault kv put kv-v1/dev/config/mongodb @mongodb.json
```
